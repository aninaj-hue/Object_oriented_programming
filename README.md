# Object_oriented_programming
In this repository, there are several projects uploaded that were implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming  (OOP) principles. 
One example is Library Management System. 
Description: This project is a library management system implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to perform various tasks such as adding and removing books, searching for books by title or author, and managing borrower information. The system uses classes and objects to model books, borrowers, and the library itself. It demonstrates the use of inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to organize and manipulate data efficiently.
